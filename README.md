  - Created tests to ensure accurate database access.
- **Mandira**: 
  - Created Docker and YAML files.
  - Implemented DDL file with table information.
  - Updated container names in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Ali**: 
  - Developed the main page of the weather app with non-functional buttons for login, registration, and city search.
  - Established connection with IP API for geolocation and tested the geo-locator function.
  - Created a function to fetch weather information from a public weather API (temperature, humidity, etc.) and display corresponding weather emojis.
- **Aliasgar**:
  - Developed a search window that retrieves city documentation and matches search input with appropriate city names.

## **Progress Relative to Requirements**
- The project is **behind schedule**, with key objectives for this milestone not fully met. 
- **Milestone Objective**:
  - Connect the main page to the search page.
  - Implement functionality to open weather information windows from the search window.
- **Completed Tasks**:
  - User location retrieval.
  - Database storing and querying.
  - City search based on name.
- **Pending Tasks**:
  - Development of weather info windows (5-day and hourly predictions, detailed weather data).
  - Finalization of login, logout, and registration functionality.
  - Dashboard implementation with features such as sharing favorite cities, customization, and adding cities to the favorites list.

## **Next Milestone Plan**
- **Team Split for Next Steps**:
  - **Team 1**:
    - Build connections between the main page and search page.
    - Create a general weather page for each city displaying interactive weather information.
  - **Team 2**:
    - Develop registration and login pages.
    - Build the dashboard page and implement logic for accessing the dashboard (conditional based on login status).
  - **Team 3**:
    - Support Team 2 with data management (e.g., Java logic for adding users to the database during registration, validating login credentials, and displaying user information in the dashboard).

- **Immediate Focus**:
  - Coordination between Team 2 and Team 3 for balanced workload and effective communication.
  - Strategy meetings proposed for Friday and Saturday to expedite task completion, manage dependencies, and ensure thorough testing.

## **Process Reflection**
- The team is using **Kanban** for task management via the GitHub project board. 
- **Positives**:
  - Tasks are flowing smoothly, and each member is responsible for their workload.
  - No **merging conflicts** have been encountered.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Communication issues** due to members being busy with various responsibilities outside the project.
  - The project pace has not met expectations, as not all objectives were completed.

## **Testing and Quality Assurance**
- **Current Status**:
  - All completed tests have passed.
  - No tests have been created for the search function or weather display function yet.
- **Next Steps for Testing**:
  - Ensure that these areas are tested in the upcoming phase for comprehensive quality assurance.

## **Release Candidate**
- **Status**:
  - The project does not have a release candidate at this stage.
  - Aiming for a functional release candidate by the next milestone.
